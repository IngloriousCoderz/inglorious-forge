# Demos

Check out the following demos to see the Inglorious Store in action on real-case scenarios:

**React Examples:**

- **[React TodoMVC](https://github.com/IngloriousCoderz/inglorious-forge/tree/main/examples/apps/react-todomvc)** - An (ugly) clone of Kent Dodds' [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/) experiments, showing the full compatibility with react-redux and The Redux DevTools.
- **[React TodoMVC-CS](https://github.com/IngloriousCoderz/inglorious-forge/tree/main/examples/apps/react-todomvc-cs)** - A client-server version of the TodoMVC, which showcases the use of `notify` as a cleaner alternative to `dispatch` and async event handlers.
- **[React TodoMVC-RT](https://github.com/IngloriousCoderz/inglorious-forge/tree/main/examples/apps/react-todomvc-rt)** - A "multiplayer" version, in which multiple clients are able to synchronize through a real-time server.
- **[React TodoMVC-TS](https://github.com/IngloriousCoderz/inglorious-forge/tree/main/examples/apps/react-todomvc-ts)** - A typesafe version of the base TodoMVC.
